# User Explorer App

User Explorer App is a modern Android application built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM**, and **Retrofit**. It allows users to browse user information retrieved from a remote REST API and perform common actions such as calling, emailing, opening websites, and viewing locations in Google Maps.

This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with modern Android development practices and architecture.
